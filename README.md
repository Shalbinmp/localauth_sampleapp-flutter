# LocalAuth Example

A sample Flutter application that demonstrates local authentication and TODO functionality.

## Overview

This Flutter project showcases the implementation of local authentication using device-specific methods (e.g., biometric authentication) and includes a basic TODO application to manage tasks. This app serves as a practical example for integrating local authentication features and basic task management in a Flutter application.

## Features

- **Local Authentication**: Secure your app with biometric (fingerprint or face recognition) or PIN-based authentication.
- **TODO Functionality**: Add, edit, and delete tasks with a simple interface.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Tasks are stored locally using a database solution.
